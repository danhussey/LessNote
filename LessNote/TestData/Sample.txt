Introduction to Machine Learning
===============================

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning
   - Classification
   - Regression
   - Examples: spam detection, house price prediction

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality Reduction
   - Examples: customer segmentation, feature extraction

3. Neural Networks
   - Neurons and Layers
   - Activation Functions
   - Backpropagation

Remember: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on using data and algorithms to imitate how humans learn.

Practice Questions:
1. What are the main types of machine learning?
2. How does supervised learning differ from unsupervised learning?
3. What is the role of activation functions in neural networks?
